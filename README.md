## Basic Work Flow
I am a software engineer that wants to complete a web application to put on my portfolio. I have already drafted the essential information for starting this project and I'm ready to start coding.

- I will first create a new project at the home page and give it a relavant name.
- I will then navigate to the project board page by clicking on my new project's thumbnail.
- Now it's time to add all of the tasks I plan to complete. I will start by adding 10-15 tasks I would like to complete this week.
- I just started implementing the first task on the board, so I will click on that specific task on the board and set it to "In Progress."
- I just finished implementing the task that is shown "In Progress", so I will now click on that task and set it as "Completed."
- I just noticed that I have a task on my project board that I decided not to implement. I will click on that task and will click the button labeled "Delete Task" and see my task get removed from the board.
